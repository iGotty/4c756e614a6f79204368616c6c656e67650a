# LunaJoy Matching Engine - System Architecture

## 📐 Architecture Overview

The LunaJoy Matching Engine is built as a modular, scalable microservice using FastAPI. It implements a progressive matching system that adapts to user engagement levels, from anonymous visitors to registered users with rich interaction history.

## 🏗️ Component Architecture

### 1. API Layer (`/app/api/routes/`)

The API layer provides RESTful endpoints organized by domain:

- **`health.py`**: System health checks and monitoring
- **`match.py`**: Core matching endpoints for all user types
- **`user.py`**: User management (future implementation)

### 2. Core Engine (`/app/core/`)

The heart of the matching system, implementing different strategies:

#### Matching Engine (`matching_engine.py`)
- **Responsibility**: Orchestrates the matching process
- **Pattern**: Strategy pattern with delegation based on user type
- **Key Methods**:
  - `match()`: Main entry point that delegates to appropriate strategy
  - `_match_anonymous()`: Cold start strategy for new users
  - `_match_basic()`: Enhanced strategy with clustering
  - `_match_complete()`: ML-powered strategy with collaborative filtering

#### Scoring Engine (`scoring.py`)
- **Responsibility**: Multi-criteria scoring calculation
- **Pattern**: Weighted scoring with dynamic adjustments
- **Components**:
  - Availability scoring (urgent vs flexible)
  - Insurance compatibility
  - Specialty matching with semantic similarity
  - Preference alignment (gender, language)
  - Load balancing across clinicians

#### Filters (`filters.py`)
- **Responsibility**: Apply business rules and constraints
- **Types**:
  - **Hard Filters**: Must-have requirements (state, appointment type)
  - **Soft Filters**: Preferences that influence scoring
  - **Exclusion Filters**: Remove previously rejected clinicians

#### Clustering Service (`clustering.py`)
- **Responsibility**: Group similar users for better recommendations
- **Algorithm**: K-means-like clustering with 8 predefined groups
- **Features**: Demographics, clinical needs, therapy experience

#### Collaborative Filtering (`collaborative.py`)
- **Responsibility**: Learn from user interaction patterns
- **Algorithm**: User-based collaborative filtering
- **Matrix**: User-Clinician interaction matrix (70k+ interactions)

### 3. Data Models (`/app/models/`)

Pydantic models ensuring data validation and type safety:

- **`user.py`**: User types and preferences
- **`match.py`**: Match results and scoring components

### 4. Services Layer (`/app/services/`)

#### Data Loader (`data_loader.py`)
- **Pattern**: Singleton for data management
- **Responsibility**: Load and cache data from JSON files
- **Features**:
  - Lazy loading
  - In-memory caching
  - Path resolution for different environments

## 🚀 Scalability Considerations

### Current Implementation
- **In-Memory Data**: Fast access for 300 clinicians
- **Singleton Pattern**: Efficient data sharing
- **Caching**: Reduces computation for repeated queries

### Production Ready Enhancements
1. **Database Migration**:
   ```
   JSON Files → PostgreSQL
   In-Memory Cache → Redis
   ```

2. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   ```
   Single Instance → Load Balancer → Multiple Instances
                                  ↓
                            Shared Redis Cache
   ```

3. **ML Model Serving**:
   ```
   Embedded Models → Model Server (TensorFlow Serving)
   ```
